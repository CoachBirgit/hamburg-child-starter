# Hamburg Child Starter

A child theme starter kit for WordPress.

## Description
This is a starter kit for a custom child theme. Child themes in WordPress enable you to override theme templates and stylesheets with your own customizations in a safe way. No need to touch an original theme file!


This starter kit uses our own theme [Hamburg](http://marketpress.com/product/hamburg/) as the parent theme. Feel free to use it for your own projects, or hack it and create your own child theme starter kit.
