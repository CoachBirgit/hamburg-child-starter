# Hamburg Child Starter

## Description
With version 3.0 of WordPress, the much anticipated feature of Child Themes 
was integrated or some might say it was improved, since it was actually possible 
to use it. We like to show you an example based on the 
Theme [Hamburg](http://marketpress.com/product/hamburg/) how you use it.
